# vplanning

VPlainng is a Flutter project to manage volunteer actions for a event (in my use case : BreizhCamp).
On iOS and Android, this app allows user/volunteer to show his actions and its details (location, duration, utils, etc.)

## Features 
* Show your event actions 
* Fetch push notifications : all hands on deck!

## Version compatability 
See CHANGELOG for all breaking (and non-breaking) changes.

VPlanning is a JD original ! #joke
